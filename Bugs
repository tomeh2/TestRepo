- There is this one ridiculously difficult bug to debug that causes sound to become... glitchy. Mostly noticable
if the same note is played frequently. Who the hell knows at this point. -FIXED (but this new method is also not really that perfect)
- Key scaling is a bit fishy
- Only free voices get updated when their properties are changed through the channel -FIXED?

- Recent observations regarding the distortion problem point to phase related issues. It would appear that
even though the frequencies of the waves are different phase differences can still introduce distortion. Tests with the
"Master Oscillator" (basically all oscillators are ran off a single timer, and each one modifies it for its own needs
rather then each oscillator having its own timer) seem to show improvement in audio quality and huge reduction in 
distortion
